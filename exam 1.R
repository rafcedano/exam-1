1. the null hypothesis is that there is no differencein marijuana smoking among 21 yo's and 57 yo's .
the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference among them.
    21     57
0 3737    6960
1 1311    936

1311/5048 = .2597
936/7896 = .1185 
.2597 - .1185 = .1412
the standard error = .0076 and .0042
the t-stat = 15.89
and the p value is close to 0 = .006
confidence interval .1412 +- .1415
since the p value is close to 0 we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there is a significant difference among smokers ages 21 and 57. 

2. the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in marijuana usage in people who went to some college and people who got a degree.
the alt. hypothesis is that there is a difference in marijuana usage among people who attended some college and people who earned a degree.

3555       3958      
3555/26302 = .1352
3958/38951 = .1016
the standard error = .0031 and .0019
the t-stat is= 11.68
the p value is close to 0 
confidence interval=.0432+-.0431
the results of this hypothesis test conclude that we should reject the null hypothesis because there is a difference in smoking among people who attended some college and people who got a degree.

4. I want to compare people who completed HS to people who earned a degree and how many people DONT smoke marijuana.
